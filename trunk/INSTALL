Installation Instructions
-------------------------

   1. Install all required dependencies: FOX-1.6.x or F0X 1.7.x

   2.	Run the build script 'gb' to start compiling Compass.
   		There are several command line options you may have to specify when running this script.
   		For a complete overview of all options use:

			>./gb --help

      We assume that all required packages are installed in /usr. If thats not the case,
      you can change the installation prefix for each package on the commandline:

			>./gb --fox-prefix=/usr/local

   3. If everything compiled fine, you are ready to install Compass in its final location.
   		By default this will be in /usr. Using the --prefix option you can tell gb to install it somewhere else.

			> su
			> ./gb install [--prefix=/usr/local]

   4. Run Compass

			> compass



Package Build Instructions
--------------------------

	To install Compass in a special package directory use the following option(s):

		> ./gb --package-root=/packages/compass/usr --prefix=/usr install

	Files will be installed in [package-root]/{bin,share...}, but the program will be configured to run from [prefix].
